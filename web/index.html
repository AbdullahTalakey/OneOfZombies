				<p><strong>One Of Zombies </strong> is a mini 2D game for play and enjoy.</p>
				<p>I would like it to be an strategy game but it is more like a kill kill game.
				  But it still has a minimal strategy elements. It supposse you have to find the
				  innocents survivors of the zombie town and save them. But if you don't want to
				  you don't need to do it, actually there is not a real end of the game, you can
				  still playing besides there are still any innocent to save or not.</p>
				<p>Just be your own.</p>

			<p class="byline"><small>To any thing people call intellingecy</small></p>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>There is a small algorithm implemented on the **tripas** of this project. It is the intellingency
				  of the not-players criatures, zombies and innocents...  </p>
				<p>They don't look very smart, did they? :) but I have tried to offer them a bit of conscience.</p>
				<p>The zombies feel **atraidos** for the hero and for the innocents that run over there. They don't follow you
				  like a **brujula** they try to find a valid road to take you.</p>
				<p>The innocents feel **atraidos** for you and the feel **miedo** of the zombies, this is because, they
				  use to follow you, but if there is a zombie near they try to run away.</p>
				<p>The intelligence is not on the zombies or in the innocents... actually it is on the flat.</p>
				<p>You, the zombies and the innocents **produc√≠s** a kind of vibration on the floor that is **propagada**
				  and in a few distance dissapear. The vibration can turn the corners but not go throw the houses, this is
				  because the innocents and zombies can feel you on the other corner of a house, but don't can 
				  feel you if is not a corner near.</p>
				<p>If you press the 'I' key during the game you will can see the vibrations of the criatures.</p>
